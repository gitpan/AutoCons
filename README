AutoCons is a cons Construct generator similar to ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Gnu 
Autoconf, except that cons is far more portable than make. For the 
developer, this means that your program will build on any system that cons 
will. For a user, this means that you don't need a "make" program to build 
your program.

Like cons itself, AutoCons 'Construct.PL's are just Perl scripts. This 
way, you can do almost anything with them, yet if nothing special is 
required, it is simple and easy to understand. AutoCons will also run any 
other '.PL' files, making recursive builds easy to implement.
