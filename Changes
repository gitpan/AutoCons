    assume the user has it.
  * Fixed directory structure for Perl scripts.
  * Fixed tests (they now work with Module::Build.)
  * Updated documentation.
  * Fixed COPYRIGHT is docs. OOPS!! I copied from a 1995 template :(
  * No longer requires YAML or Archive::Tar unless you are making a 
    package.
  * Supports /bin/tar instead of Archive::Tar, if you have /bin/tar. It'll 
    still use if you don't have /bin/tar.
  * 'cons -- test' works without a t/ directory.
